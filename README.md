# transit-js-example

This repository is an example [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) application that uses
[transit-js](http://github.com/cognitect/transit-js) to marshal data between
server and client without the typical out-of-band application logic required
when marshalling [JSON](http://json.org).

To run the application first install the Node and Bower dependencies:

```shell
npm install
node_modules/.bin/bower install
```

You can then run the application with:

```shell
node main.js
```
